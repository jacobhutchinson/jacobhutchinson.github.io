intro: |
  I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from Northeastern University. Riding out this pandemic as well as can be expected and learning all the while. I have experience in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Natural Language processing, in theory and in practice. I took several relevant classes while in college and began seeking out online classes myself in order to learn more and get ready for the workforce. While responsibly quarantining during this pandemic I have begun to upgrade my skills toolbox to include FILL IN <br/><br/>
  FILL IN PARAGRAPH ABOUT PROJECTS<br/><br/>
  FILL IN WORK EXPERIENCE/CALL-TO-ACTION, also if you're seeing this then sorry about that, this site's not done yet nor am I done learning. I will fill in the above when I officially start full-time job searching after I round out my skillset with more online classes<br/><br/>
